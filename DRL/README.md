# Online 3D Bin Packing with Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning

![teaser](pictures/state_architecture.png)

## Introduction
```
This repository contains the implementation of paper [Online 3D Bin Packing with Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14978.pdf).

Any contribution is welcome! If you have any recurring problems, please contact me at alexfrom0815@gmail.com.
```

## Install

```
To make this project work, there are two things you should do:
* Install python packages in 'requirements.py' (by 'pip install -r requirements.txt').
* Register our binpacking environment(envs/Bpp-v0) in your gym (discussed in https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/626).
```

## Run
We provide an unified interface in 'main.py'. There are examples of running our project.

For trainingï¼š
```
Example: Train a new model on sequences generated randomly.
You can run 'python main.py --mode train --load-model False --use-cuda --item-seq sample'.
It will take about one day to get a model with satisfying performance.

You can run 'python main.py --help' for some information of common parameters.
There are many other parameters of our project in 'config.py', all of them are given default values.You can change it if you like.
```

For test:
```
Example:
If you want to test a model trained on sequences generated by CUT-2 Algorithm(get more details in our article).
You can run 'python main.py --mode test --load-model True --use-cuda --data-name cut_2.pt --load-name default_cut_2.pt'.

If you want see how the model work in lookahead setting,
You can run 'python main.py --mode test --load-model True --use-cuda --data-name cut_2.pt --load-name default_cut_2.pt --preview x', x is the lookahead number.

Codes of user-study application, multi-bin algorithm, MCTS for comparison are also provided,
Please check 'user_study/', 'multi_bin/', 'MCTS/' for details.
```

## Tips
```
* Different input state sizes need different kinds of CNN for encoding, you can adjust the network architecture in ./acktr/model.py to satisfy your needs. 

* Predicted mask is mainly for reducing MCTS computing costs. If you only need BPP-1 model, you can replace predicted mask with ground-truth mask during the training and it will be easy for training.

* If you relax the constraint of stability rules, you may get a better result, but it may be dangerous in practice.

* The computing overhead of our implementation is sensitive to the length of network layer, you should aviod a large network layer appears in your network architecture. 

* Bin packing problem's difficulty is related to its item set. The trained model's performance is also affected by it.
